# Password-Generator-with-Python
**Objective**

- The objective of this project was to strengthen my Python skills while exploring cybersecurity principles. By creating a robust password generator script, I aimed to deepen my understanding of Python fundamentals like randomization and string manipulation, while also delving into password security concepts. Adhering to industry best practices, the goal was to develop a generator capable of producing secure passwords with optimal length and complexity. Through problem-solving, this project facilitated the development of critical thinking skills essential for cybersecurity challenges.


**Skills Learned**

- Understanding of randomization and its importance in secure password generation.
- Proficiency in using Python libraries such as random and string.
- Ability to implement user input handling for customized password criteria.
- Enhanced knowledge of best practices in creating strong, secure passwords.
- Development of programming skills, including writing clean and efficient code.


**Tools Used**

- Python programming language for scripting.
- Python standard library modules like random and string.
- Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for writing and testing the code.


**Steps**

1. Import necessary modules
2. Generate password function
3. Password validation function
4. Check password strengh function
5. Generate and display password/strength
